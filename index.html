  <H1>Information Architecture Work</H1>
  <p>
   In addition to thinking and teaching about Information Architecture for the past 8 years, I have also been able to work on projects relevant to creating positive user experiences by optimizing inhouse tools, or creating new ones. Some of my favorite are highlighted below.</p>

     <h2>University Digital Asset Management System</h2>
     <p>
       The communications and public affiars department at a large R1 university adopted a digital asset management system (DAM) to help incorperate partners into their workflow. The system incorperated legacy structures and the wanted to optimize their policy and procedures regarding the informaiton architecture in order to ensure system use. I created the artifacts below and provided additional consulting services. The project is on going as they higher staff in reponce to recommendations I made.

           This document was created to manage the metadata of objects uploaded to the DAM. It balanced usability, with structure.

          This graphic is a revised directory structure for the DAM. It had a legacy sturcture that had additional adhoc elements. This saught to minimize the ad hoc nature of suplimental directories, and bring older directories into compliance with newer ones.

  <h2>Our Knowledge Community</h2>
  <p>
    This project was undertaken in support of research efforts of a professor. The professor, wanted an accessable web based directory that could be used to foster communities of practices within different church congrigations. The project required the use of word press, and the Cognizent Form plug-in. Using these constraints I created a website that allowed congrigations to enter informaiton and for members to be able to see information in their church but not others. The website was designed to scale up becoming more complex as the researh project developed. The color choice of these documents was determined by the researcher's desires.

      This diagram was made to document the desired exprience of using the website. Developing this gave me the frame work to figure out other demands and communicate project requirments to non-technical stakeholders.

      This diagram defined the requirements for the site related to plugins. It really helped me make choices when I was choosing which plugins to use to build the site. In particular, it helped me to articulate the way in which user login, permissions, and information interacted.

     <h2>Ph.D Work</h2>
     <p>
       Over the last 4 years I have been working on completing a Ph.D in Library and Informaiton Science. My focus has been on knowledge use in creative processes (with a focus on design teams). I have continued to expand on experiences I had in web work and used my experiences to aid in the creation of diagrams and visualizations to help me understand the often complex documents I worked with. Below is a selection of work completed for classes and my dissertation. Additional work can be found on my website: <a href="http://zacharyfrazier.com/projects">http://zacharyfrazier.com/projects</a>

          I made this for a class I was taking in the psychology department. I was tasked with presenting on a series of review articles dealing with the history of developmental psychology. Under time preasure I determined that diagraming the relationships would be the most effective way to present the information. Later as I did more work in the class I expanded the diagrams to include the expanded knowledge base.

         I presented at the 2017 IAsummit in Vancouver BC. I've been thinking alot about what virtual spaces means for the experience of using information systems. This talk is the result of the desire to talk about information architecture in enviroments the typical two dimensional interaction.

        In addition to taking classes, I also taught classes. This is the syllabus I developed for User Centered Information Architecture. I produced numerous tutorials, examples, and demos for the class, and lectured about a variety of UX and IA related topics.
