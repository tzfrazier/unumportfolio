  <H1>Information Architecture Work</H1>
  <p>
    In addition to thinking and teaching about Information Architecture for the past 8 years, I have also been able to work on projects relevant to creating positive user experiences by optimizing in-house tools, or creating new ones. Some of my favorites are highlighted below.

     <h2>University Digital Asset Management System</h2>
     <p>
       The communications and public affairs department at a large R1 university adopted a digital asset management system (DAM) to help incorporate partners into their workflow. The system incorporated a legacy file structure and the stakeholders wanted to optimize their policy and procedures to improve workflows. They saw implementing thoughtful information architecture as an easy way to ensure system adoption and use. I created the artifacts below and provided additional consulting services. The project is ongoing as they hire staff in feedback made during the project.

          This graphic is a revised directory structure for the DAM. It had a legacy structure that used ad hoc elements brought over from previous. The revised structure sought to minimize the ad hoc nature of supplemental directories and bring older directories into compliance with newer ones.

  <h2>Our Knowledge Community</h2>
  <p>
    This project was undertaken in support of research efforts for a professor. The professor wanted an accessible web based directory that could be used to foster communities of practices within different church congregations. The project required the use of WordPress, and the Cognizant Form plug-in. Within constraints I created a website that allowed congregations to enter information and for members to be able to see information in their church, but not others. The website was designed to scale up becoming more complex as the research project developed. The color choice of these documents was determined by the researcher's desires.

    This diagram defined the requirements for the site related to plugins. It really helped me make choices when I was choosing which plugins to use to build the site. In particular, it helped me to articulate the way in which user login, permissions, and information interacted.

     <h2>Ph.D Work</h2>
     <p>
Over the last 4 years I have been working on completing a Ph.D. in Library and Information Science. My focus has been on knowledge use in creative processes (with a focus on design teams). I have continued to expand on experiences I had in web work and used my experiences to aid in the creation of diagrams and visualizations to help me understand the often-complex documents I worked with. Below is a selection of work completed for classes and my dissertation. Additional work can be found on my website: <a href="http://zacharyfrazier.com/projects">http://zacharyfrazier.com/projects</a>

          I made this for a class I was taking in the psychology department. I was tasked with presenting on a series of review articles dealing with the history of developmental psychology. Under time pressure I determined that diagraming the relationships would be the most effective way to present the information. Later as I did more work in the class I expanded the diagrams to include the expanded knowledge base.

         I presented at the 2017 IA summit in Vancouver BC. I've been thinking a lot about what virtual spaces means for the experience of using information systems. This talk is the result of the desire to talk about information architecture in environments the typical two- dimensional interaction.

       In addition to taking classes, I also teach classes. This is the syllabus I developed for User Centered Information Architecture. I produced numerous tutorials, examples, and demos for the class, and lectured about a variety of UX and IA related topics.
